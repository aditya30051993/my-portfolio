## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability, **do not create an issue**.

Instead, send an email to [aditya30051993@gmail.com](mailto:aditya30051993@gmail.com) with the subject "Vulnerability Report".

You can expect updates on the report as it progresses.

Thank you for helping keep the project secure!
